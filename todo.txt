BitString Operators:
	[x] not
	[x] or
	[x] and
	[x] xor
	[!] shift left (add support for arbitrary shifts)
	[ ] shift right
	[ ] add
	[ ] subtract
	[ ] append bit string
	[ ] append integer
	[ ] append integer truncating to given length

BitString Constructors:
	[x] empty
	[x] empty with capacity
	[ ] all zeros
	[ ] all ones
	[ ] repeating byte
	[ ] from integer
	[ ] from integer truncating to given length
	[ ] from String/&str (utf8 binary representation)?

Other BitString Methods:
	[x] len (in bits)
	[ ] capacity (in bits)
	[ ] get nth bit
	[ ] set nth bit
	[ ] bit iterator
	[ ] bit count
	[ ] clone

Blocks:
	[x] 8,16,32,64-bit
	[ ] 128-bit (SSE optimized)
	[ ] 256-bit (AVX optimized)
